# Library

## Description

   The Library app is a console-based application that simulates library operations. A customer can apply for a library card, view their checked-out items, and ask for a book transfer. An employee can approve or deny accounts and view checked-out items for their customers.
	
## Purpose

## Requirements
1. Functionality should reflect the below user stories.
2. Data is stored in a database.
3. Data Access is performed through the use of JDBC in a data layer consisting of Data Access Objects.
4. All input is received using the java.util.Scanner class.
5. Log4j is implemented to log events to a file.
6. A minimum of 10 JUnit tests are written to test some functionality.

Project Evaluation Parameters
1) Your project will be evaluated based on coverage of technology rather than the user stories.
2) How well you present, naming conventions, separation of code into various classes, how well have you applied OOP and design patterns.
3) So you could focus less on user stories and more on coverage of concepts/technologies which you learned during the training.
